<h1>In a world named Crivett everyone starts with 10 lives
where if you die you lose a life but if you kill someone you get a life.
The more lives you have the stronger you are, the less lives
you have the weaker you are.
If you lose all your lives you can only come back if 
someone revives you. And the story starts with Flareon.  


<h3>Flareon was 19 on earth when he was accidentally killed by a god due to a failed experiment
he was reincarnated into a world named Crivett the god told him he needs to level up to gain more power 
and continued explaining how the world works. Then he spawned in a forest while gods flew around in the air 
gathering resources to continue building a structure for everyone without a house.


<body> Flareon decided to relax before starting his adventure.
He walked over to a peaceful beach with sand glimmering like small diamonds in the
sun and small rocks scattered around Flareon walked over to the edge of the sand and sat 
down by the water while gazing at the waves flow. 
A man then appeared behind him and sat down beside Flareon looking over into the horizon Flareon 
Said to the man Hello? The man replied hello with a voice with a small part of sadness hidden in it. Flareon replied, 
is something wrong? Wellâ€¦ you see i only have 1 life left the man replied Flareon stated well why don't we work together. 
They started exploring the area together they walked through a forest desert and many mountains
